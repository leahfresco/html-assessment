<!--doctype html
A form that asks the user:
their first and last name (as separate fields),
their salary requirement as a number, and
which job they are applying for, as a dropdown from a list of:
Software Engineer
QA Engineer
Product Manager
The form should use HTML 5 input types for validation.
The form should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL path /application-success. This should be a POST request. (For now, just focus on the HTML requirements for this request. Donâ€™t build a Flask route, yet.)
The page should have a large heading and some explanatory text, as well.-->
